# NYC Executed Evictions Analysis

### Project Overview

For my first data analysis project, I analyzed executed residential evictions in NYC from 2017 to late 2023 using NYC's Open Data Evictions dataset. In my analysis, I wanted to identify residential evictions trends before, during, and after COVID-19, identify which borough(s) and zip codes have the highest number of residential evictions, and which months see the highest numbers of evictions.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the TK FILE.csv file, containing NYC Open Dataâ€™s Evictions dataset, which contains basic data about  executed evictions within the five boroughs reported by New York City Marshals, for the year 2017 - Present. The data fields include but are not limited to Court Index Number, Docket Number, Eviction Address, Executed Date, Residential or Commercial (property type), Borough, and Zip Code.
