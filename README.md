# NYC-Evictions Analysis

### Project Overview

For my first data analysis project using SQL, I analyzed executed residential evictions in NYC from 2017 to late 2023 using NYC's Open Data Evictions dataset. 

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the TK FILE.csv file, containing NYC Open Dataâ€™s Evictions dataset, which lists all executed evictions within the five boroughs reported by New York City Marshals, for the year 2017 - Present. The data fields include Court Index Number, Docket Number, Eviction Address, Executed Date, Residential or Commercial (property type), Borough, Zip Code and other relevant data.
