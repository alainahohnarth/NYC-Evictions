# NYC Executed Evictions Analysis

### Project Overview

For my first data analysis project, I analyzed executed residential evictions in NYC from 2017 to 2023 using NYC's Open Data Evictions dataset. In my analysis, I wanted to identify residential evictions trends before, during, and after COVID-19, identify which borough(s) and zip codes have the highest number of residential evictions, which months see the highest numbers of evictions, and gain an overall better understanding of residential evictions in NYC.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the TK FILE.csv file, containing NYC Open Dataâ€™s Evictions dataset, which contains basic data about executed evictions within the five boroughs reported by New York City Marshals, for the year 2017 - 2023. The data fields include but are not limited to Court Index Number, Docket Number, Eviction Address, Executed Date, Residential or Commercial (property type), Borough, and Zip Code.
